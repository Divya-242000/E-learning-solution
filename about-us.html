	<p><h4>The internet and digital devices and materials have made it possible for individuals to access their 
        classes without the need to visit a physical classroom.
        An TLS makes the learning experience interactive and engaging. 
        It makes students be active members in the learning experience.
        The system makes sure that the student is engaged in the learning process by turning the common
         learning areas into engaging learning models.<h4></p>
            
            <p><h4>Here are the 5 ways which can make the learning experience engaging and interactive:</h4></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="w3-container w3-white" style="color: black;">

  <h5><b>On-Demand Learning<b></h5>
  <p>Some students have a shy attitude that can sometimes make them not to participate in a typical classroom actively. 
      They have a personality that prevents them from engaging with others or asking questions in class. 
      That can ultimately make their learning curve to decline. An LMS can help in this as it gives the student a 
      digital means to communicate, collaborate, and connect with tutors and other students.
    The system puts the students in an environment for on-demand learning as they can learn at their convenient 
    space and time.</p>
</div>
<div class="w3-container " style="color: white;">
  <h5><b>Parent Interaction<b></h5>
  <p>Parents and other stakeholders in the development and learning of students require an 
      independent means of tracking the progress of the students.
    A good LMS like Tutorroom.com comes with user privileges and roles that parents can 
    utilize to interact with their child's teachers. That involvement of parents ensures that the students are 
    disciplined.</p>
</div>
<div class="w3-container  w3-white" style="color: black;">
  <h5><b>Performance Tracking<b></h5>
  <p>It is not easy to measure real learning without a proper platform. 
      Modern-day learning management systems have made that easy with performance tracking systems.
    They provide students with a detailed view of their progress for further improvement.</p>
</div>
<div class="w3-container "style="color: white;">
    <h5><b>Personalization<b></h5>
    <p>In densely crowded classrooms, a student can easily get lost in the attendance role. 
        The lack of attention has a significant role in minimizing a student's learning ability.
        A learning management system can assist in that to provide a personalized learning experience.
        That encourages the student to learn further and also help them to keep track until you complete your course.
        The personalization comes in various forms like the pace of the course, course outline, and student avatars. All these have a positive influence on a childï¿½s overall development.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="w3-container w3-white" style="color: black;"" >
    <h5><b>Gamification<b></h5>
    <p>Gamification is a popular feature among the top web and mobile apps today. 
        It is the inclusion of a point-scoring system that is similar to gaming elements that encourage 
        the user to do more with the app.
        Most LMS use gamification to keep the users engaged in their software. They entice the students to do 
        more tasks voluntarily, which enhances their learning experience.</p>
